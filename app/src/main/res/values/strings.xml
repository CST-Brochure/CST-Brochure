        Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering takes minimum of four years full time. The programme would provide
        access to larger numbers of suitably qualified nationals to be trained as engineers to meet the needs of Bhutan.
        The increased supply of engineers would also support private sector growth thereby creating additional jobs and
        strengthening the economy. The courses have been designed to meet the requirements of Bhutan’s unique engineering
        demand. The graduates will find employment in Civil Service, Corporations and Private sector.\n\n

    The programme aims to be innovative in course and curriculum development in order\n\n

    i. To attract and recruit students of good academic ability and potential from all social groups.\n\n
    ii. To develop the potential of each student to meet new challenges and to lay the foundation of versatility of
        thinking they will need in careers as professional engineers.\n\n
    iii. To provide students with an engineering education with breadth across the engineering disciplines, combined
        with some specialist learning, delivered with design as an integrating feature.\n\n
    iv. To understand the importance of professionalism, management, and problem solving techniques for works.\n\n
    v. To allow career progression and educational development to study for a Masters degree
    Civil engineering students learn how to analyze and solve problems related to construction and maintenance of bridges,
        buildings, airports, waterways, and water and waste-water treatment facilities, hydraulic structures.\n\n
      vi.  they also learn how to communicate their solutions of these problems (their designs) to others and how to transform their
        designs into reality. Civil engineering is a challenging, creative and satisfying career.\n\n

    Students also have a unique opportunity to experience aspects of the civil engineering profession by making visits to sites.\n

        Civil Engineering graduates are expected to be able to:\n\n

    1. formulate and prepare project proposals and plans.\n\n
    2. design, analyse, prepare working drawings and estimates of various civil engineering structures
    execute/supervise the construction of various civil engineering structures.\n\n
    3. carry out survey for civil engineering works.\n\n
    4. carry out feasibility studies for civil engineering projects.\n\n
